Java Exercise 1
Energy Drink Consumption
A soft drink company recently surveyed 12467 of its customers. It found that:
• Approximately 14% of customers surveyed purchased one or more energy drinks per
week
• Approximately 64% of customers surveyed preferred citrus flavored energy drinks
Write a program that displays the approximate number of people who purchased one or more
energy drinks per week and the approximate number of people who preferred citrus flavored
energy drinks.
Store the number of customers in the survey in an integer variable. Use string concatenation to
embed the calculation in the output statement. Use only the value provided in the survey.
Sample output is shown below:
According to a survey of 12467 people:
1745 customers surveyed purchased one or more energy drinks per week.
7978 customers surveyed preferred citrus flavored energy drinks.
Tips:
• Hardcoding is allowed for this question.
• Notice that the number of customers in the output are expressed as an integer.
Movie Quotes
Write a program that displays two movie quotes, the movie that the quote comes from, the
actor (and movie character) and the year the movie first aired. Use print or println statements
as well as newline, double quotes and tab escape sequences to format your output according to
the rules below:
• The entire quote should be enclosed in double quotes.
• The entire quote should be tabbed by two tab spaces.
• You can use print or println statements, but you must use the newline escape sequence
as well.
• Skip a line between the quote and the movie information.
• Insert a dashed line (looks like “------”) between the first and second quote.
Here is an example of the output of such a program:
"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want.
If you are looking for a ransom, I can tell you I don't have money.
But what I do have are a very particular set of skills,
skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that
make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go
now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not
pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you,
and I will kill you."
Movie: Taken
said by: Liam Neeson (as 'Bryan Mills')
Year: 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------
"I had another Liam Neeson nightmare.
I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.
They made three of those movies. At some point,
you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent."
Movie: Deadpool
said by: Ryan Reynolds (as 'Wade Wilson')
Year: 2016
Tips:
• You may use as many or as few print/println statements as you wish! Just make sure the
code looks neat and easy to read.
• You can insert your own quote as long as:
o It is at least three lines long J
o It is not laced with profanities L
Ingredient Adjuster
A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:
• 1.5 cups of sugar
• 1 cup of butter
• 2.75 cups of flour
The recipe produces 48 cookies with these amounts of the ingredients.
With this information, write a program that asks the user how many cookies he or she wants to
make, and then displays the number of cups of each ingredient needed for the specified number
of cookies. Use constants to store the amount of sugar, butter, flour and cookies in the standard
recipe and create variables as needed to store the adjusted amounts of ingredients.
Samples of the output is shown below:
Output Sample 1:
Enter the number of cookies: 150
To make 150 cookies, you will need:
4.6875 cups of sugar
3.125 cups of butter
8.59375 cups of flour
Output Sample 2:
Enter the number of cookies: 75
To make 75 cookies, you will need:
2.34375 cups of sugar
1.5625 cups of butter
4.296875 cups of flour
